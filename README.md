# Cryptoasset Service Providers Dossiers
This repository contains research dossiers on Cryptoasset Service Providers, such as VASPs, custodians, OTC desks and exchanges. 

The goal with this repo is to demonstrate how investigators can:
- Identify and profile crypto service providers.
- Assess risk factors (licensing, jurisdiction, compliance history).
- Link blockchain entities to real-world organisations.

## Structure
- `dossiers/` → Profiles of individual providers (exchanges, custodians, OTC desks, on-ramps).
- `templates/` → A standard template used for all dossiers.
- `visuals/` → Supporting images and diagrams.

## Sources & Methodology
Research is based on:
- FATF definitions of VASPs.
- Public regulator registers (FCA, FinCEN, etc.).
- Company registries (e.g. Companies House UK).
- Official VASP websites and compliance pages.
- Credible media reports and blockchain explorer labels (with disclaimers).
